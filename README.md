### About this web application

This web application allows you to reserve one or several books easily. It contains a *Home page*, an *User panel*, an *Administrator panel*, *one page for each book avaible on the site* and a page when you can *request a new book*.

Like an user, all you are allow to do is sign-up and, once you are a registered user, you can reserve a book, change your profile data, request a new book and write a review about the book you've read.
