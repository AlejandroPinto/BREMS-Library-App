### About this web application

This web application allows you to reserve one or several books easily. It contains a *Home page*, an *User panel*, an *Administrator panel* and *one page for each book avaible on the site*.

Like an user, all you are allow to do is to sign-up and, and, once you are a registered user, you can reserve a book, change your profile data, request a new book and write a review about the book you've read.

#### Home page

This is the main page of the library. You can find here the information about all the avaible books, navigate through the site and see your profile data and notifications. If you are an unregistered user, instead of see your profile, you can press *Sing-up* button to join our community. You can't leave a comment or reserve a book if you are unregistered.

#### User panel

This page allows you to change you private data (avatar, name, address, user ID...). Some data are automatically generated and you won't be able to change it (for example, your library member number, number of reserved books...). Access is restricted to unregistered users.

#### Administrator panel

The site administrator is able to use this page to manage: users, avaible books (add and remove), comments (delete, if a comment is inappropiate, and edit).

// IMAGE

#### Data page for each book

Each book of the library has its own page, which contains much information about the book: title, short description, large description, author, year of publication, literary genre, reader's feedback... Only administrators of site can manage the page and modify its info.
